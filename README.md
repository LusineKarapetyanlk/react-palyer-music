        # React + Vite
            This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
            Currently, two official plugins are available:
            - [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
